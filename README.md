# Enron-email
Enron Corp. was famous for fraudulently manufacturing audit reports which eventually led to their bankruptcy. Before bankruptcy, about 20000 people were employed at Enron and it was a major producer of electricity, natural gas etc. Investigations into the company at the time revealed that the senior management had played a pivotal role in covering up the true audit numbers.    We attempt to analyze if there was something that could be done from any "righteous" individual of senior management at Enron. We do so by exploring the email dataset of Enron that involves conversations between most senior management officials leading up to the company's bankruptcy.
